    The VC dimension depends on the input space as well as $\hipotset$. For a fixed $\hipotset$, consider two input spaces $\xset_1 \subseteq \xset_2$. Show that the VC dimension of $\hipotset$ with respect to input space $\xset_1$ it at most the VC dimension of $\hipotset$ with respect to input space $\xset_2$.
    
    How can the result of this problem be used to answer part (b) in Problem 2.16?
    
    \textit{[Hint: How is Problem 2.16 related to a perceptron in $D$ dimensions?]}
