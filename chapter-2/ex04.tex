    Show that $B(N, k) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{k-1} \binomial{N}{i}$ by showing

    $$ B(N, k) \ge \sum\limits_{i=0}{k-1} \binomial{N}{i} $$
    
    To do so, construct a specific set of $\binomial{N}{i}$ dichotomies that

Here is a hint. Lets consider showing B(5,2)>=1+5; It suffices to list 6 dichotomies on 5 points such that no subset of size 2 is shattered.

Consider the following 6 dichotomies on 5 points:

[1 1 1 1 1] (zero -1s)

[-1 1 1 1 1] (5 ways of having one -1)
[1 -1 1 1 1]
[1 1 -1 1 1]
[1 1 1 -1 1]
[1 1 1 1 -1]

Can you show that no subset of 2 points is shattered? Hint: are there any two points that are classified -1,-1?

So, in general, you can guarantee that no subset of size k can be shattered if no subset of size k is classified all -1. This means that at most k-1 points are classified -1 by any dichotomy.
