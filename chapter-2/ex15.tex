    The monotonically increasing hypothesis set is
    
    $$ \hipotset = \{ h~|~ x_1 \ge x_2 ~ \Rightarrow ~ h(x_1) \ge h(x_2) $$
    
    where $x_1 \ge x_2$ if and only if the inequality is satisfied for every component.
    
    \letra{a} Give an example of a monotonic classifier in two dimensions, clearly showing the $+1$ and $-1$ regions.
    
    \letra{b} Compute $m_{\hipotset}(N)$ and hence the VC dimension. \textit{[Hint: Consider a set of $N$ points generated by first choosing one point, and then generating the next point by increasing the first component and decreasing the second component until $N$ points are obtained.]}
